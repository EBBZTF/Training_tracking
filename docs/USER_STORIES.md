# User stories

What this app is supposed to do, told as real situations rather than a feature list. Written after
reviewing how comparable apps solve the same problems (see [Competitive notes](#competitive-notes))
and after an interview with the product owner (see [Decisions](#decisions)).

Status legend: ✅ built · 🟡 partly built · 🔴 missing

## Personas

**Emma** — the owner. Trains a self-designed calisthenics/gym program, cares about exact numbers
(box height in cm, left/right sets counted separately, band strength), plus running and bouldering
on the side. She wants the app to be a training diary *and* a schedule.

**Jonas** — a new account. Wants "running Mondays and Thursdays, 30 minutes, and bouldering on
Fridays" on a calendar. He does not want exercise lists, sets or reps, ever. He is the user the app
used to fail: he got Emma's pistol-squat program handed to him on signup.

---

## E1 — Account and first run

### US-1.1 Register and land in my own empty app ✅

> Jonas installs the PWA, taps "Registrieren", enters mail and password, and is in.

Registration, login, refresh tokens and per-user data isolation work today
(`AuthScreen`, `AuthService`, JWT filter).

Was broken: `useTrainingState.ts` seeded `defaultPlan()` — "Unterkörper + Pistol", the shared hip
block — into every brand-new account, with `dayId` hardcoded to `'mo'`, and `resetPlan()` restored
that same personal program. Now `src/data/plan.ts` exposes `emptyPlan()`, nothing is seeded, nothing
is written until the user creates something, and `Plan.hip` is optional so no one inherits a block
repeated on every day.

**Acceptance criteria**
- A new account has **no** workout plans and **no** planned sessions.
- "Zurücksetzen" in the data sheet clears back to empty, not to the pistol program.
- Nothing in `src/data/defaultPlan.ts` describes one specific person's training.
- Emma's existing plan is untouched — it lives in Postgres, not in the seed.

### US-1.2 Get told how the app works, once ✅

> Jonas' calendar is empty. Instead of an empty grid, a short wizard asks what he wants to do,
> how often, and at what time — and when he taps through, his month is filled in.

Progressive, skippable onboarding is the consensus pattern: ask the few things that unlock the
first useful screen, and teach the rest in place (Fitbod asks only about experience before showing
a first workout). A wizard is justified here because there *is* a required setup sequence — an empty
calendar is a dead end.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Runs only when the account has no plans and no planned sessions; never again after that.
- Every step is skippable; skipping lands on the calendar with an inviting empty state
  ("Noch nichts geplant — tippe auf einen Tag").
- Step 1: pick activities from the seeded types (Laufen, Kraft, Bouldern, …) or create one.
- Step 2: per activity, a rhythm — weekdays or "alle N Tage" — plus a time.
- Step 3: summary, "Los geht's", which writes real recurring rules and lands on the calendar.
- The wizard explains, in one line each, the two things Jonas cannot guess: that tapping a
  calendar day plans a session, and that an activity can carry a detailed workout plan if he wants
  one.
- Re-runnable on demand from the data sheet ("Einführung nochmal ansehen").

### US-1.3 Log out on a shared device ✅

> Emma hands her tablet to a friend and logs out first.

Built (`DataSheet` → `onLogout`). Tokens cleared, back to `AuthScreen`.

---

## E2 — Planning: the calendar

### US-2.1 See the month at a glance ✅

> Sunday evening. Emma opens the calendar and sees the week ahead: colored pills per day.

Built (`CalendarView`, 6×7 grid, Monday-first, pills tinted per session type, done/skipped dimmed,
month navigation, "Heute").

### US-2.2 Plan a single session on a day ✅

> Emma is invited bouldering on Thursday. She taps the 27th, picks "Bouldern", saves.

Built (`AddSessionSheet` → `POST /api/planned-sessions`). The sheet never sent `time` even though
`PlannedSession.time` and `scheduled_time` both existed, so "07:00 laufen" was impossible to express
on creation; it has a time field now, and pills show it.

**Acceptance criteria**
- The add sheet has an optional time field, sent on create.
- Calendar pills show the time when one is set, ordered by time within the day.

### US-2.3 Move a session that did not fit ✅

> It rained Monday morning. Emma opens the session and moves it to Tuesday.

Built (`SessionDetailSheet` → `onReschedule`, optimistic update, rollback on failure).
Interacts with recurrence — see US-2.6.

### US-2.4 Tick a session off, or admit I skipped it ✅ / 🟡

> Emma got back from her run and marks it "gemacht".

Built (`markStatus`, `planned | done | skipped`).

The gap: **nothing connects logging to the plan.** A logged `Session` is keyed by
`(date, dayId)` and knows nothing about the `PlannedSession` on that date, so filling in every set
of Monday's gym workout leaves the calendar entry stubbornly "planned", and Emma has to mark it
done by hand.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Logging any value for a workout on a date flips that date's matching planned session to "done"
  automatically, once, without stealing a manual "skipped".
- Manual override still wins: marking "skipped" stays skipped.

### US-2.5 Delete a session ✅

Built (`removeSession`, optimistic with rollback). Scope prompt needed once recurrence lands
(US-2.6).

### US-2.6 Set up a rhythm, not 30 single entries ✅

> Emma wants: every Monday and Thursday, gym; every third day, mobility. She sets it up once.

Built as `recurring_rules` + `recurring_rule_exceptions` (V4), with occurrences materialized into
`planned_sessions` the first time a date range is requested — so status, notes and logging work on an
occurrence exactly as on a one-off, and no read path needs to know about rules. Intervals.icu and
TrainingPeaks both treat the calendar as the primary surface with repeatable plans applied to it;
Hevy and Strong instead keep *routines* reusable and let you schedule them.

**Acceptance criteria**
- A rule carries: activity type, optional workout plan, optional time, and a pattern —
  either **weekly on chosen weekdays** or **every N days**.
- Start date, optional end date; open-ended is allowed and renders indefinitely into future months.
- Occurrences appear in the calendar visually identical to single sessions, with a subtle
  repeat marker.
- Different rules can pin different plans to different weekdays: *Monday → Oberkörper,
  Friday → Unterkörper*, both of type "Gym". (Two rules, one type.)
- One rule per activity+pattern; editing the rule updates all future occurrences at once.

### US-2.7 Change one occurrence without wrecking the series ✅

> Emma moves *this* Monday's gym session to Tuesday because of a dentist appointment. Next Monday
> must stay Monday.

Built. The established option set is "this occurrence" / "this and all future" / "all"; Apple
Calendar shows the first two, and so does this app — no retroactive edits. A single-occurrence edit
detaches that row and records an exception; a scope=future edit splits the rule so occurrences
already generated before it keep the old pattern.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Editing, moving or deleting an occurrence of a series prompts:
  **"Nur dieser Termin"** / **"Alle künftigen Termine"**.
- "Nur dieser Termin" writes an exception, so the series is otherwise untouched.
- Deleting a single occurrence hides exactly that date, permanently, and survives a reload.
- Deleting all future occurrences ends the series at that date; past occurrences and their logged
  data remain.
- No prompt at all for a session that is not part of a series.

### US-2.8 Recurrence, but the plan changes over time ✅

> After eight weeks Emma swaps the Monday plan from "Aufbau" to "Intensiv".

Falls out of US-2.7: edit the rule, choose "alle künftigen Termine", done. Explicitly *not* in
scope: periodized multi-week programs that progress weights automatically (Hevy Trainer territory).

---

## E3 — Activity types

### US-3.1 Pick from sensible activities out of the box ✅

> Jonas expects "Laufen" to already exist. It does — but it is called "Jogging".

Eight types are seeded globally (`V3__add_session_types_and_planned_sessions.sql`), which is right.
They were seeded in **English** (`Jogging`, `Strength`, …) inside an otherwise German app; V5
renames the global rows in place, so ids and every reference to them survive.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Seeded labels are German: Laufen, Kraft, Bouldern, Radfahren, Schwimmen, Yoga / Mobility,
  Ruhetag, Sonstiges.
- Renaming is a migration on the global rows only; user-created types are untouched, and existing
  planned sessions keep pointing at the same ids.

### US-3.2 Add my own activity with its own color ✅

> Emma starts climbing outdoors and adds "Klettern" in pink.

Built (`AddSessionSheet` → "+ Neu", label + color + optional icon, per-user, unique per user).

### US-3.3 Clean up an activity I no longer use 🟡

> Emma stopped swimming and wants "Schwimmen" out of her chip row.

Backend and hook exist (`deleteCustomType`, `removeSessionType`, refuses while sessions reference
it) but **no UI calls it** — `removeSessionType` is dead code. Global types are correctly
undeletable (`custom: false`).

**Acceptance criteria**
- Custom types are deletable where they are shown, with the "noch verwendet" conflict surfaced as a
  readable message rather than a silent failure.

---

## E4 — Workout plans

### US-4.1 Create a workout plan for an activity 🟡

> Emma creates "Oberkörper" and attaches it to "Kraft". Jonas never opens this screen.

`NewPlanSheet` creates a plan with title, short label and a `slot` (morgens/nachmittags).
Two problems: a plan has **no link to an activity type**, and `slot` is a leftover from the
personal program — with real times on the calendar, a morning/afternoon flag is redundant.

**Acceptance criteria**
- A plan belongs to exactly one session type, chosen on creation and changeable later from inside
  the plan.
- Scheduling flows type-first: pick "Kraft" → pick which Kraft plan (or none). Types without plans
  (Laufen) never ask.
- `slot` is dropped in favour of the session time.

### US-4.2 Several plans under one activity 🔴

> "Gym" is not one workout. Emma has Oberkörper, Unterkörper and Ganzkörper, all Gym.

Directly from the interview, and the reason type and plan must stay separate concepts rather than
collapsing into one.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Any number of plans per type; the plan picker groups them under their type.
- The calendar pill shows the plan name when one is pinned, the type name otherwise.

### US-4.3 Build up the plan's content ✅

> Emma adds a "Kraft" block, puts "Bulgarian Split Squat" in it, unilateral, 3 sets left, 3 right.

Built and genuinely good: blocks by kind, bilateral/unilateral exercises with separate left/right
set counts, seven measurement types (kg, band, sek, bw, cm, m, min), reps as free text, notes,
reordering, edit mode (`ExerciseEditor`, `planOps`).

### US-4.4 Rename or delete a plan I no longer use 🔴

> The "Testphase" plan was a dead end. Emma wants it gone.

`planOps` has `addDay` but no delete and no rename; a plan created by accident is permanent.
There is no `deleteBlock` either.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Plans can be renamed and deleted from edit mode, with a confirmation.
- Deleting a plan leaves past logs readable and detaches — not deletes — planned sessions that
  pointed at it (`day_id ON DELETE SET NULL` already does the right thing).
- Blocks can be deleted.

### US-4.5 Remind me what an exercise is ✅

Built (`InfoSheet` + `descriptions.ts`, `attachDesc` reattaching descriptions on load).

---

## E5 — Doing the training

### US-5.1 Open the app and see today's training ✅

> Monday 06:55. Emma opens the app and wants Monday's gym workout, nothing else.

Was: the Plan tab (`Tabs.tsx`) rendered **every** plan unconditionally, with no relation to what was
scheduled — the second half of the "still focused on my old gym plan" complaint. Now the strip is
schedule-driven in log mode, and plan-driven only in edit mode (an unscheduled plan still has to be
editable, which is the one deviation from the original acceptance criteria).

**Acceptance criteria**
- The tab strip shows **only days with something scheduled** in the current month — Mon, Tue, Fri
  if that is what is planned; the empty days in between do not appear.
- The strip scrolls horizontally, left and right, within the month.
- The day matching the selected date is preselected and scrolled into view.
- Each tab shows weekday and date plus the plan or activity name.
- Nothing scheduled all month → an empty state pointing at the calendar, not a blank bar.
- A scheduled activity without a plan (Laufen) shows as a tab too, with a minimal detail view —
  it is still a thing Emma did that day.

### US-5.2 Log a set the moment I finish it ✅

> Between sets, thumb on the phone: tap the set, type 62.5, done.

Built (`ExerciseTrack` → `EntrySheet`, per side and set index, immediate persist).

### US-5.3 See what I lifted last time ✅

> Emma cannot remember Monday's weight. The previous value sits greyed next to the input.

Built (`lastVal`, most recent earlier session for that exercise/side/set).

### US-5.4 Tick off the warm-up ✅

Built (`WarmupSection`, per-session checkboxes).

### US-5.5 Jump from a calendar entry into the workout ✅

> Emma taps Monday's gym pill, then "Training starten".

Built (`SessionDetailSheet` → `onStartWorkout` → switches `dayId` and view). Requires the session
to have a plan linked.

### US-5.6 Log something I did yesterday ✅

Built via the date picker in the header. Must keep working once the tab strip is schedule-driven —
picking an earlier date has to show that date's scheduled training.

---

## E6 — Looking back

### US-6.1 Review a past session ✅

Built (`HistorySheet`).

### US-6.2 See whether I actually did what I planned 🔴

> End of month: Emma wants to know whether "3× Kraft pro Woche" happened.

Nothing aggregates planned vs. done, though the data is all there
(`planned_sessions.status` per type and date). Weekly totals are the one feature every planning
app in this space converges on (Intervals.icu shows them per week on the calendar itself).

**Acceptance criteria**
- Per week, per type: planned / done / skipped counts, on or next to the calendar.
- Cheap version first: a compact strip under the month grid. No charts, no training-load model.

### US-6.3 Track progress on one exercise 🔴

> "Was my box pistol height going down?" — the numbers are logged, but only readable session by
> session.

Deliberately parked; noted so it is not mistaken for an oversight.

---

## E7 — Data and account

### US-7.1 Export and import my data ✅

Built (`DataSheet`, JSON round-trip through `importState`).

### US-7.2 Start over ✅

> Emma wants a clean slate.

Built. "Zurücksetzen" used to restore the personal pistol program; the button now reads "Alle Pläne
löschen" and clears to empty, and the sheet offers "Einführung nochmal ansehen".

---

## Decisions

From the interview, these are settled and not up for re-litigation while implementing:

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| First run | Wizard that asks activities, rhythm and time, and writes real recurring entries |
| Starter templates | **Dropped.** No template library, no starter programs |
| Default plan | No plan is seeded for anyone; the pistol program is not offered at all |
| Recurrence | Real recurring rules: weekly on chosen weekdays, or every N days |
| Editing an occurrence | Apple-Calendar prompt: "Nur dieser Termin" / "Alle künftigen Termine" |
| Series end | Open-ended allowed; optional end date; no retroactive edits to past sessions |
| Session fields | Date, time, type, note. **No** duration, **no** distance, **no** logged actuals |
| Plan ↔ type | A plan belongs permanently to one type; the type is editable from within the plan |
| Multiple plans per type | Required — several Gym plans, scheduled individually |
| Recurrence ↔ plan | A rule pins a specific plan: Monday this plan, Friday that plan |
| Plan tab scope | Only days with something scheduled, horizontally scrollable, within the month |
| Language | German; seeded English type labels get renamed |

## Competitive notes

What the neighbours do, and what this app should take from them.

- **Hevy / Strong** — routine-centric strength logging: reusable routines, folders, one-tap
  pre-made programs, and scheduling on top. Hevy added algorithmic programming that auto-progresses
  weights (Feb 2026). *Take:* routines (our plans) are reusable objects, scheduled repeatedly, not
  bound to a date. *Leave:* auto-progression, social feed.
- **Intervals.icu / TrainingPeaks** — calendar-first: drag a workout from a library onto a day,
  planned vs. completed side by side, weekly totals, plans applied in bulk. *Take:* the calendar as
  the primary surface, weekly planned-vs-done totals (US-6.2). *Leave:* training-load modelling,
  device sync.
- **Apple Calendar / Google Calendar** — the recurrence UX everyone already knows: flexible
  patterns, and a scope prompt on edit and delete. *Take:* verbatim, minus the "all events"
  (retroactive) option.
- **Fitbod and fitness onboarding generally** — progressive, skippable onboarding: ask the minimum
  that unlocks a useful first screen, teach the rest in place. *Take:* three short steps, all
  skippable, ending on a filled calendar.

## Built so far

1. **No seeded plan** (US-1.1, 7.2) — `defaultPlan()` gone, `emptyPlan()` in its place, `Plan.hip`
   optional, reset clears to empty.
2. **Recurring rules** (US-2.6, 2.7, 2.8) — V4: `recurring_rules`, `recurring_rule_exceptions`,
   `rule_id`/`occurrence_date` on `planned_sessions`; weekly-mask and every-N-days patterns;
   materialization on range read; scope-aware move/edit/delete with rule splitting;
   `POST /api/recurring-rules`; `scope` on the planned-session write endpoints, which answer 204 when
   a change hit the rest of a series.
3. **Onboarding wizard** (US-1.2) — three skippable German steps that write real rules.
4. **Schedule-driven Plan tab** (US-5.1) — log mode shows only scheduled days of the month with
   month steppers; edit mode still lists plans.
5. **Time on create** (US-2.2) and **German seed labels** (US-3.1, V5).
6. **Plan links survive a plan save** — `planned_sessions.day_id` was a FK to `days(id)`, which
   `PUT /api/state` deletes and recreates on every save, silently nulling the link. Now stored as
   `day_key`.

## Still open

1. **Plan ↔ type binding** (US-4.1, 4.2) — column on `days`, type-first pickers, drop `slot`.
2. **Auto-done on logging** (US-2.4) — logging a workout should tick its planned session off.
3. **Delete/rename plans and blocks** (US-4.4), **delete custom type UI** (US-3.3).
4. **Weekly planned-vs-done strip** (US-6.2).

## Resolved

- **Language:** German only. No i18n layer, no language switch — new copy is written in German like
  the rest of the app.
- **Month boundaries:** the strip stays inside one month. At the end of it, a small arrow button
  labelled "nächster Monat" moves on (and its mirror image for the previous month).
